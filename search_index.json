Tidy: Make sure each column in your data is a variable and each row in your data is an observeration. Transform: Filter your data to specific observations, mutate existing columns into new columns, and summarize data. Visualize: Visualization is an important component of data exploration, but usually isn’t very useful for automated processes. Model: Once you know what you’re asking, you can use a model to answer those questions. Models tend to scale well. Communicate: Communication is a critical part of data science! It doesn’t matter how good your models are if nobody knows about them. Program: Programming can aid the entire process, and unlock things that wouldn’t be possible to determine by hand.

Learning to program helps us simplify the other steps. We might then get into modeling and communicating, or we might pick those up in books that are more specifically devoted to those skills.

It takes care of many of the fiddly details that make plotting a hassle (like drawing legends) as well as providing a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics.” © Hadley Wickham 2013 The {ggplot2} package is one of the {tidyverse} packages, it lets us build up plots layer by layer.

Let’s start with making an empty plot: ggplot() + geom_blank() The ggplot() function can be used by adding data inside the function as its first argument, and adding a mapping as a second argument: ggplot( data = &lt; some data &gt; , mapping = aes( x = x , y = y )) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;() "],["geometry.html", "3.3 Geometry", " 3.3 Geometry There are several different types of of &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;: geom_ point (scatterplot) line smooth histogram / bar or (stat_count) / col boxplot map text … "],["aesthetic-mappings.html", "3.4 Aesthetic mappings", " 3.4 Aesthetic mappings Aesthetics are visual properties of objects in the plot.

A super common error: Trying to set the color inside the aes call results in random effects because aes() automatically figures out the necessary scale for your data. ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = &quot;blue&quot;)) "],["common-problems.html", "3.5 Common problems", " 3.5 Common problems What is very important when deciding on a visualization of your data?

For example, geom_bar(aes(x = cut)) calculates a count for each cut. ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut)) stat_*() functions do this calculation. ?stat_count (etc) has a Computer variables section that tells you what that stat computes. You can use these computed variables to make fancier plots. 3.6.3 Position adjustments Geoms have a position argument to tell it how to deal with things that go on top of one another. Sample values include “stack”, “identity”, “fill”, “dodge”, and “jitter”. geom_jitter() is a shortcut for geom_point(position = \"jitter\") because it’s super useful. dat &lt;- tibble( x = rep(1:3, 3), y = rep(1:3, 3) ) ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_jitter() Use width and height arguments of geom_jitter to more specifically specify range. ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.5) 3.6.4 Coordinate systems Add Coordinate systems to your ggplot with: coord_flip() coord_quickmap() coord_polar() coord_fixed() By default, {ggplot} uses coord_cartesian() but you can add other functions: coord_flip() can be useful to quickly flip orientations (although this is less necessary in modern {ggplot} than when this book was written; now there’s an “orientation” argument that is usually guessed properly if you leave it blank) coord_quickmap() does proper transformations to work with lat/long data. coord_polar() for circular plots, which are almost always a bad idea but they tend to look cool coord_fixed() set the same limits to both axis 3.6.5 Theme Once your data are imported, tidied and transformed adeguately for obtaing desired visualization you can start setting up a plot with extra features: ?theme It is possible to add a theme() function to your ggplot, this is done to customize the non-data components of your plots: titles labels fonts background gridlines legends … For example if you would like to customize the background of your plot: ggplot() + geom_blank() + theme(plot.background = element_rect(color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 2, fill = &quot;gold&quot;), panel.background = element_rect(color = &quot;grey&quot;, size = 5, fill = &quot;darkblue&quot;)) Or you can customize a theme_, there are many different themes provided by defauld by ggplo2 such as: theme_classic() theme_minimal() theme_void() just to name a few, those function then can be further customize by adding the theme customization function.

Cumulative and rolling aggregates: cumsum() cumulative sums, cumprod() cumulative products, cummin() cumulative min, cummax() cumulative max, cummean() cumulative means. Logical comparisons: &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, !=, and == Ranking: min_rank(x) gives ranks from smallest to largest. min_rank(desc(x)) gives ranks from largest to smallest. row_number(), dense_rank(), percent_rank(), cume_dist(), ntile().
